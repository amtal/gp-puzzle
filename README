Trying to solve trivial puzzles the easy way. With genetic programming.

    OVERVIEW
Game.hs     game rules
Simple.hs   solving specific games
???         generating a generic solver

    RESULTS THUS FAR
After some tweaking of fitness function and generation function, successfully
solves problems and seems to generate pretty efficient results.

Required human understanding of:
 - algorithm size being a factor, with small size being a problem
 - fitness function overvaluing size, resulting in fast size reduction

This strikes me as reasonable, and implementation-specific understanding. It
doesn't seem to be problem-specific overfitting, but very general stuff. That's
good :)
