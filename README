Trying to solve trivial puzzles the easy way. With genetic programming.

    OVERVIEW
Game.hs     game rules
Simple.hs   solving specific games
???         generating a generic solver

    RESULTS THUS FAR
Flaky. If the parameters are human-tweaked, success can be achieved. (Like all
GAs/'machine' learning, hurr.)

Problem seems to lie in the code generation. It's either too shallow (and thus
provides weak results and can't be crossed over) or deep enough to eat up
memory 'til it hits the swap.

Not sure if it's a laziness issue inside the library, or me misunderstanding
and misusing it. Since the example's use of terminals (which should generate
1-deep trees always?) confuses me, probably the second.
